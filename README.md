# Updated-Portfolio

This project is an updated version of a previous responsive webpage. This responsive page adapts to the screens of different viewing devices, allowing for wider use across different platforms. The adaptability of webpages is incredibly important these days, wherein consumers surf the web in a variety of forms: laptops, phones, tablets. Having the ability to have your webpage accessed from multiple sources allows greater ease of use for consumers, so that they do not have to deal with the frustration of a trying to interact with a webpage that is not meant for their screen size. This will then increase traffic to the site. I appreciate the opportunity that I had to work on such an exciting and relevant project. During the course of the development of these pages, I learned that spacing and indentation plays a critical role in how a webpage displays.
