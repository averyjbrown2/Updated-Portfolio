    <h3>
        <p>I recently completed the Full Stack Flex Bootcamp program at UNCC to earn 
            my certificate as a Full Stack Web Developer. In this program, students learned both 
            front-end and back-end coding, including Javascript and React. I hope to begin a 
            career in web development that will allow me to bring my creativity and 
            resourcefulness to new and exciting projects.
