    <h2>Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
    <h3>I received my certificate as a Full Stack Web Developer from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in 2021.
         I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in 2014. I have worked in a variety of fields since 
         graduation, and have recently completed the Full Stack Flex Bootcamp program at UNCC to earn my certificate as a 
         Full Stack Web Developer. In this program, students learned both front-end and back-end coding, including Javascript and React. 
         I hope to begin a career in web development that will allow me to bring my creativity and resourcefulness to new and exciting projects.
    </h3>
